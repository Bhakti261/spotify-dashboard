Objective:
The Spotify Dashboard is designed to visualize your personal Spotify data, including listening habits, top tracks, and favorite artists. This helps analyze trends in music preference over time and gain insights into listening behavior.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python: For data processing and analysis.
Pandas: To clean, manipulate, and organize Spotify data.
Plotly / Matplotlib / Seaborn: For creating interactive and static visualizations.
Streamlit: To build an interactive web dashboard where users can view graphs and charts.
CSV files / APIs: To extract Spotify data for analysis.

Workflow / Steps:
Data Collection: Export your Spotify history (listening history, top tracks, and top artists) from Spotify in CSV format.
Data Cleaning: Remove unnecessary columns, handle missing values, and format dates and times using Python.
Data Analysis: Use Pandas to calculate top tracks, top artists, total listening time, and other statistics.

Data Visualization:
Create bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to show trends.
Use Plotly for interactive visualizations in the dashboard.

Dashboard Creation:

Use Streamlit to make an interactive interface.
Include filters (like time period, artists, or genres) for better user experience.

Insights: Users can see which songs or artists they listen to most, how their music taste changes over time, and patterns like peak listening hours.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Handling real-world CSV data and performing cleaning and transformation.

Building interactive visualizations to make data insights accessible.

Understanding user behavior through data analytics.

Developing end-to-end dashboards using Python and Streamlit.
